# Kodi Steam BPM Launcher
Kodi addon script for launching Steam in BPM without AHK to avoid triggering anti-cheat.



## Why?
For launching Steam in Big Picture Mode while killing Kodi in the background, then restoring it on Steam quit.

There is a long-standing addon script already, but it uses AutoHotkey and there is a possibility some games that detect cheats and or macros will pickup on use of AHK scripts or binaries - especially shooters and gachas looking for macro abuse - so I wanted a different solution.

This simply executes cmd builtin commands to do the job, so no risk of anticheat issues.



## Usage:
Install the zip file from the release tab, or the repo via the Kodi addon installer.

You can right click the addon and change the Kodi install path in settings.


## Extension:
Feel free to edit the resources/main.py and add launch options for other operating systems.

My HTPC needs to be running Windows in my household so I haven't added os check and execute code for others.
